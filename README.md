# Ford Car Price Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts the prices of Ford cars using a dataset with features such as model, year, mileage, transmission, fuel type, and engine size. The workflow includes data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and building regression models.

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Import the dataset and required libraries.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and understand the data distribution and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
4. **Model Training**: Train regression models to predict car prices.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like R² and Adjusted R².

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Installation
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Open `ford-price-prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run each cell sequentially to follow the workflow.

## 📁 Dataset
- `ford.csv`: Contains the Ford car data used for analysis and modeling.

## 🖼️ Example Visualizations
- Distribution of car prices
- Correlation heatmap
- Boxplots for categorical features vs. price

## 🧑‍💻 Interactive Exploration
- Modify the notebook to try different models (e.g., RandomForestRegressor).
- Change feature engineering steps and observe the impact on model performance.
- Visualize new relationships or trends using your own plots.
